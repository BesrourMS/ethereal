# Ethereal
HTML5UP Ethereal Template For Pico CMS

Download the ethereal folder, extract it to the themes folder of your Pico installation, and change the following setting within your config.php:

`$config['theme'] = 'ethereal';`

For Pico CMS >= 2.0 add to config/config.yml
```sh
theme: ethereal
```
(If the file does not exist, create it. For more info see config/config.yml.template)

For the content download our `index.md`, upload it in the content folder and make your changes.

You can add as many social icons as you want using the follow syntax:

```
Social:
  https://tn.linkedin.com/in/MohamedSafouanBesrour: linkedin
  https://github.com/BesrourMS: github
  url: icon
```

(Make sure to use spaces for indentation and not tabs!)

For the Social Icons we use [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).  You can find a list of all available icons [here](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/).

For your Profil Image, you can add an image to your site and specify its path using the meta Image variable in the index.md:
`Image: images/pic01.jpg`

For the Background replace the `bg.jpg` in Ethereal's `images` folder with your own background image.

Recommended Sizes:

`pic01.jpg => 525x900 px | bg.jpg 1440x900 px`
